    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      This page highlights places that I have been and places that I would like to go.  My wife and I enjoy traveling abroad and are trying to squeeze in as many trips as possible before starting a family.  Although working full time and going to school part time doesn't afford us much extra time, it is always fun to make time for travel and have something to look forward to.  We are excited to see what adventures 2016 hold for us!
